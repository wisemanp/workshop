Welcome to the webpage of the "New advances in NIR type Ia supernova science" workshop funded by a grant from the Pittsburgh Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology Center ([PITT-PACC](http://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/pittpacc)).

## Rationale

Optical observations of SNe Ia have been widely used in the last decades to measure cosmological distances, and have been key in measuring the Hubble constant and demonstratibg cosmic acceleration. In recent years, the literature sample of optical SN Ia at cosmological distances has grown substantially, and at this point statistical errors are comparable to systematic uncertainties. Further improvement in reducing these systematic errors would require a much better understanding of the physical model of the explosion, which is still incomplete, a direct observational constraint on which kind of progenitors can produce SNe Ia, which is still lacking, as well as a better control of reddening effects due to interstellar and/or circumstellar dust.

Increasing evidence suggests that SNIa are very nearly ‘natural’ standard candles at NIR wavelengths, even before correction for light-curve shape or reddening, yielding more precise distance estimates to their host galaxies than optical data alone. Compared to the optical, SNe Ia in the NIR are both better standard candles (σ_H ∼0.12 mag), and relatively immune to the effects of extinction and reddening by dust (extinction corrections are by a factor of 4-6 smaller than in the optical). However, SNe Ia cosmology in the NIR is still poorly developed compared to the optical, since current efforts are focused on increasing the number of objects and are constrained to low redshifts (z<0.2).

Because dust and color are the biggest topic of debate, discussion, and confusion in SNe Ia today reducing sensitivity to dust is a significant gain in the power of luminosity-distance measurements to constraint the dark energy equation-of-state parameter. This 3-day workshop will bring together the latest observational groups in Type Ia supernovae in the near infrared along with theorists and modelers working actively in this field to best understand and exploit the new data and insights to tackle the biggest systematic
uncertainty in Type Ia supernova cosmology. It will be very timely to discuss how to extract the best science out of the data sets and how to ensure consistent calibration and agreement across the datasets, and discuss about on-going analyses, unexplained issues, and future plans regarding SN Ia cosmology in the NIR.

## Venue

The workshop will be held at the **University Club** on the University of Pittsburgh campus, address: 123 University Pl, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.

Hotel:

We have arranged for a block of rooms at the **Wyndham University Center** Pittsburgh, just two blocks from the meeting location, for the nights of 04/10-04/13.  Those wishing to book after registration for the conference has been confirmed, do not contact the hotel directly. Instead, please email Cindy Cercone at cmc138(at)pitt(dot)edu with which nights you wish to reserve. She will make reservations and send you a confirmation number with the hotel, along with further travel details.  The discounted room rate is $145+tax.

Getting to the Hotel/University Club:

There are several options for reaching the Hotel from the Pittsburgh International Airport.  A taxi should cost ~$50-60, while Uber or Lyft should be ~$30-40.  Super Shuttle is ~$25 for a shared ride van.  There is a Port Authority bus line from the airport with stops near the hotel, the 28X (link) that runs every half hour from 5:30 am to midnight.  The fare is only $3.75, though the trip will take slightly longer than an hour. Exit the bus at Forbes and Schenley Drive (by a large Diplodocus dinosaur statue), the Wyndham hotel is then on the opposite side of the Cathedral of Learning, the 42-story building at the center of Pitt's campus.
